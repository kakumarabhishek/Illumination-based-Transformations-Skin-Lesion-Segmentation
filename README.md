## Dependencies
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- PIL
- SciPy (==1.1.0; for `imread` and `imresize`)

We also need to convert between the RGB and HSV color spaces, and `scikit-image` provides this functionality. However, `scikit-image` has issues with NumPy<sup>[1](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12744),[2](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/3586),[3](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/3906)</sup>, and therefore to avoid installing it, we have borrowed the necessary functions from `scikit-image` [source code](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/tree/dfb7a0922a4d4cc4841c74c1657086ca5d8a6b35) and put them in `skimg_local.py`.

## Usage

An example usage is shown in `Transformations.ipynb`, and three sample skin lesion images from the [ISIC Archive](https://www.isic-archive.com/) are included in the `images` directory.
